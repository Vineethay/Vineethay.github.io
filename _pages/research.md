<!--The objective is to utilize labelled source domain data along with unlabelled target domain data effectively recognize facial expressions in the target domain. Proposed **D**ata **I**mbalance and **F**eature **C**onfusion(DIFC) module to mitigate the effect of class imbalance due to labeled source
domain samples, while also reducing confusion among classes in target domain.

Cross-domain Few Shot Learning
======
The problem of Cross-domain Few-shot image classification is to recognize new classes given limited labelled training data, which also come from an unseen domain. We propose a simple label preserving feature augmentation module that can aid learning with less samples. -->
